      <LegalSection heading="2. Overview">
        <p>
          UNIKMO lets you create, store and share private digital Moments (video, audio, images or text) that a recipient
          opens through a unique private access code connected to a physical card. Checkout and payment are handled by
          Stripe. Historical orders may continue to reference Shopify during our payment-provider transition.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="3. Product nature">
        <ul className={bullet}>
          <li>Each purchase grants one or more private access codes.</li>
          <li>Each code allows creation of one (1) digital Moment.</li>
          <li>Moments are private and accessible only through the corresponding code.</li>
          <li>No account or login is required for you or the recipient.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="4. Your responsibility for the access code (important)">
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for storing your private access code securely and giving it to the intended
          recipient. UNIKMO never sends the code to recipients. If a code is lost, shared by mistake, or accessed by a
          third party, UNIKMO is not liable.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="5. Key usage rules">
        <ul className={bullet}>
          <li>One private access code equals one Moment.</li>
          <li>Once a Moment is created it cannot be edited or reassigned.</li>
          <li>Codes and cards may not be resold or redistributed commercially.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="6. Content responsibility">
        <p>You are fully responsible for the content you upload. You agree not to upload:</p>
        <ul className={bullet}>
          <li>illegal content;</li>
          <li>content that infringes someone else&rsquo;s rights, including copyright;</li>
          <li>offensive, abusive, deceptive or harmful material.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may remove content that breaches these Terms or the law at any time.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="7. Storage &amp; availability">
        <p>
          Moments are stored on cloud infrastructure. We aim for long-term storage but do not guarantee permanent
          availability, and we may modify, migrate or discontinue storage services with reasonable notice where possible.
          Keep your own copy of anything important.

            cancellation right would otherwise apply) that right is lost once we have begun.

      <LegalSection heading="9. Delivery">
        <p>
          Delivery options are shown at checkout (for the standard cards: Physical + Digital, Digital only, or Split; for

      <LegalSection heading="12. Limitation of liability">
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, UNIKMO is not liable for loss of content, unauthorised access,
          service interruptions, or indirect, incidental or consequential damages (including emotional distress). Our
          total liability for any claim is limited to the amount you paid for the order giving rise to the claim. Some
          jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so parts of this section may not apply to you.

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="13. Changes to these Terms">
        <p>
          We may update these Terms. Changes take effect when posted, and the &ldquo;last updated&rdquo; date above will
          change. Your continued use after a change means you accept the updated Terms.

      <LegalSection heading="14. Governing law &amp; disputes">
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of {COMPANY.governingLaw}, without regard to its conflict-of-law rules.
          The state and federal courts located in Wyoming have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute, and you consent
          to venue there.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a consumer resident outside the United States, this choice of law and venue does not deprive you of
          the protection of mandatory consumer-protection provisions of the country in which you habitually reside, and
          you may also be able to bring proceedings in your local courts.
