      <LegalSection heading="1. What cookies are">
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website. &ldquo;Similar technologies&rdquo;
          includes local storage and pixels. They can be set by the site you are visiting (first-party) or by another
          provider (third-party), and can last for a single session or persist for a set period.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="2. What we currently use">
        <p>
          On unikmo.com itself we use <span className="font-medium text-[#22323A]">only strictly necessary cookies and
          equivalent local storage</span>. These keep the site running and let you complete a purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          For traffic measurement we use <span className="font-medium text-[#22323A]">Vercel Web Analytics</span>, a
          privacy-friendly, <span className="font-medium text-[#22323A]">cookieless</span> tool. It records aggregate page
          views and referring sites. It does not set cookies, does not store any identifier on your device, does not track
          you across other websites, and is not used for advertising. Because it does not store or read information on your
          device, it does not require a consent banner.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do <span className="font-medium text-[#22323A]">not</span> use advertising, retargeting or marketing cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Checkout and payment take place on Stripe. When you proceed to checkout, Stripe sets its own strictly
          necessary cookies to process the order securely and prevent fraud, under Stripe&rsquo;s own cookie and privacy
          notices.

            <span className="font-medium text-[#22323A]">Strictly necessary cookies</span> are exempt from the consent
            requirement under the EU ePrivacy rules because they are essential to provide a service you have requested.

            or access information on your device, so the ePrivacy consent requirement does not apply. The limited
            aggregate data it produces is processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in understanding and
            improving the site (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)); you can object at any time by contacting us.

            <span className="font-medium text-[#22323A]">Preferences and marketing cookies</span> would only be set with
            your prior consent (GDPR Art. 6(1)(a) and the ePrivacy Directive as implemented in your country). Because we
            do not use them, no consent banner is shown.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If we introduce cookies or similar technologies that are not strictly necessary, we will first present a consent
          banner that lets you accept or reject each category before any such technology is used, and update this policy
          with the specific cookies, providers and durations.

            Most browsers let you block or delete cookies and local storage in their settings. Blocking strictly
